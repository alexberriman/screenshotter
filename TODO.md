# 📸 Screenshotter CLI - TODO

A focused CLI tool for taking screenshots in automated environments, particularly for capturing work-in-progress from development tools.

---

## 🏗️ Setup & Infrastructure

- [✅] Create proper TypeScript project structure:
  - [✅] `src/index.ts` - CLI entry point with shebang
  - [✅] `src/screenshot.ts` - Core screenshot logic
  - [✅] `src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - [✅] `src/utils/` - Helper functions
  - [✅] `src/config/` - Default configuration
- [✅] Set up build pipeline with tsup
- [✅] Configure npm scripts for development and build
- [✅] Add `.gitignore` with proper exclusions

---

## 🎯 Core Functionality

- [✅] Implement basic screenshot capture:
  - [✅] Use Playwright (not Puppeteer) for better performance
  - [✅] Accept URL as command argument
  - [✅] Take full-page screenshot by default (to confirm - if the page is beyond 100vh i.e. is scrollable, we need to screenshot the ENTIRE page)
  - [✅] Save with timestamp-based filename
- [✅] Add essential CLI options:
  - [✅] `-o, --output` - Output file path
  - [✅] `-t, --timeout` - Page load timeout (default: 30s)
  - [✅] `-w, --wait` - Additional wait after page load
  - [✅] `--no-full-page` - Capture only viewport
- [✅] Implement error handling:
  - [✅] Use ts-results for functional error handling
  - [✅] Proper exit codes (0 success, 1 error)
  - [✅] Clear error messages to stderr

---

## 🔧 Automation-Friendly Features

- [✅] Add viewport support:
  - [✅] `-v, --viewport` - Specify viewport size (e.g., "1920x1080")
  - [✅] Common presets: desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), mobile (375x667)
- [✅] Add wait strategies:
  - [✅] Wait for network idle
  - [✅] Wait for specific selector (optional)
  - [✅] Custom wait time after load
- [✅] Output control:
  - [✅] Support PNG and JPEG formats (default to png)
  - [✅] JPEG quality option
  - [✅] Filename template support (with placeholders)
- [✅] Reliability features:
  - [✅] Retry on failure (configurable)
  - [✅] Timeout handling
  - [✅] Network error handling

---

## ✅ Quality & Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for:
  - [✅] Viewport parsing utility
  - [ ] Error formatting
  - [✅] Filename generation
  - [ ] Command argument validation
- [ ] Integration tests for:
  - [✅] Basic screenshot capture
  - [ ] Error scenarios
  - [✅] Different viewport sizes
- [✅] Add github actions workflow for pushes to main to lint, typecheck, test and build

---

## 📦 Publishing & Documentation

- [✅] Create comprehensive README:
  - [✅] Installation instructions
  - [✅] Usage examples for common scenarios
  - [✅] Automation examples (CI/CD, scripts)
  - [✅] Error troubleshooting guide

---

## 🚀 Docker

- [ ] Docker image for containerized usage

**Note**: Focus on core functionality first. This tool should be simple, reliable, and perfect for automation scenarios like capturing Claude Code output or development progress.
